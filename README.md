# Games
This repo will be dedicated to simple game projects I will be making.
The language I will be using is python for now. Some potential libraries include pygame and/or tkinter.
When I have free time, I intend to make a GUI for every game in here.

### The Games so far include:
1. Hangman
2. Rock-Paper-Scissors
3. Tic-Tac-Toe
